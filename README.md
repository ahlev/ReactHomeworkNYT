I thought this homework was due this *coming* Thursday! Bah.


 #This app should allow users to search the NYT Articles API, using a React interface with a form field, and return a list of results. The results should have the option to "save" to a saved section using MongoDB.

 *Update on submission*

Still having trouble with my Express Routes and MongoDB layers here, but the basic React framework (not beautified) works and the axios request returns NYT article results that get mapped to the DOM.

I have a Save button rendering for each, but I need to debug to make this active. Right now, the onClick method I pass through as a prop isn't firing, and the MongoDB layer is idle anyway. Need to wrap my head around those elements better.

But here's my apparently late - whoops :( - scramble to take a crack at it and submit. I want to get this full functionality working in the near future, though.
